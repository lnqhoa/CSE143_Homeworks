Assignment #4 Evil Hangman   

What did you learn this week?
This week I learned about maps and the keys + values. 

What did you enjoy in the course this week?
It is cool to see how maps represent data structures in real life but in a less complicated way through the class.

What did you find challenging or frustrating this week?
The data structures are getting a lot more complicated and it is hard to find/manipulate variables. 

What did you find particularly helpful for your learning this week?
I think doing the Ed lessons along with the videos that walk through the problems help.
